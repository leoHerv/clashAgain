# Clash Again  
  
### Description :   
Clash Again is a game like Clash Royale but with less functionality.  
You can pause the game, summon different units such as the knight, the dragon, the archer or even the gargoyle.  
And that's it, the goal is to knock down the two towers of the other player who is a bot.  
  
### What I learned : 
I learned a little better the SLD library and in particular how to better use .png images.  
  
### Compilation :  
The game was made with the codeBlocks IDE so to launch the game you will need it.  
-> open the .cbp file.  
  
### Specifications :  
This is a school project for my second year of my computer science degree.  
It was made in C with the SDL library, on Windows (comments in French).
