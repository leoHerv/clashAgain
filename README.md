# clashAgain


Clash Again is a game like Clash Royale but with little functionality.  
You can pause the game, summon different units such as the knight, the dragon, the archer or even the gargoyle.  
And that's it, the goal is to knock down the two towers of the other player who is a bot.  

The game was made with the codeBlocks IDE so to launch the game you will need codeBlocks.  
Project in french.
